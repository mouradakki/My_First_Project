# First HTML & CSS Project

This is my first practical project after completing an HTML and CSS course, which I followed through YouTube and various learning platforms.

## 🧠 Project Idea

The goal of this project was to apply what I learned and turn theory into a working web page. I implemented the main skills I acquired, such as:

- CSS styling (colors, spacing, alignment, etc.)
- Hover effects on buttons and interactive elements
- Using Flexbox or Grid to structure the layout
- Building a simple responsive design
- Dividing the page into clear sections: Header, Main Content, and Footer

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to transform a static design into a web page using HTML and CSS
- Writing clean, organized, and readable styles
- Improving the visual appearance and interactivity of elements
- Attention to detail and layout design
